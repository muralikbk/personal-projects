These are the timed projects that I did either for the follwing reasons:
1) Timed coding challenges
2) Offline interview questions with time limits
3) Online interview questions

Because of the time constraints, the codes are in a "quick and dirty" mode. Other than removal of any organization identifying information, addition of problem statement in comments and filenames, ehe code hasn't been changed since it was submitted.
